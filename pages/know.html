        <h3>What you didn’t know about the Panda Bear</h3>
        <h5>Shocking TRUTHS that will COMPLETELY change your view on life</h5>
        <br>

        <div class="row">
            <div class="col-sm-7">
                <h6><br>What you need to know:</h6>
                <p>In the beginning of time, the world was created with birds, fish, and panda bears. The panda bear was not just a myth, but a beloved creature that roamed not only the bamboo forests, but also the streets and commonplaces of the people.
                    They became pets and associates to the people of the past.</p>
                <p>So what happened between now and then that makes our favorite animal only available to us in a short zoo visits and television programs?<br><br></p>

                <h6>The TRUTH:</h6>
                <p>The panda DOES NOT EXIST. Not anymore. Are you shocked? You should be! That’s why it is our job, and now that you’re aware, YOUR job to inform everyone of this crazy revelation!</p>
                <p>Remember how when you were younger people were panicked about panda extinction? Turns out, pandas went extinct long before they brought it up in schools. Humans didn’t take care of these furry friends, and only once it was too late did
                    they try to save the gentle giants.<br><br></p>
            </div>
            <div class="col-sm-3"><img src="/CP1/images/panda.png" style="width:450px"></img>
            </div>
        </div>

        <h6>SO what’s the SCOOP on ZOOS?! :</h6>
        <p>All pandas in today’s world, including our zoos, are fake. For years, humans have gone through strenuous training, learning to dress like pandas and imitate their actions. </p>
        <p>Have you ever seen a panda up close? You won’t want to! The closer you get, the more obvious it will be that you’re looking at just another human, just like you, no bear genetics involved. <br><br></p>

        <h6>Other common TRAPS:</h6>
        <p>Live baby pandas have appeared sneezing in viral internet videos. The facts prove that these videos are fake, edited, and usually involve puppies painted to look like pandas. </p>
        <p>Also, what people think are modern images of pandas are IN REALITY only just drawings done by the practiced hand.<br><br></p>

        <h6>WHAT NOW:</h6>
        <p>Please donate to the “pandas are fake” awareness page and help people everywhere know what the government doesn’t want them to know. You’ve seen the facts. <br><br></p>
